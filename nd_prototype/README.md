# ND NUFFT research prototype (historical)

This directory preserves a standalone research prototype for rank-generic
N-dimensional NUFFT with
per-dimension "translation-rank placement" — NOT part of the wgpu-fft /
wgpu-nufft crates. It is retained as a reproducible reference oracle and
historical design record. This README is self-contained; no private design
vault is required.

Each dimension independently chooses how to pay its translation rank r(eps):

| placement | mechanism | fine grid | per-dim cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SPREAD_S2` | ES-kernel spreading, sigma=2 | 2N | w(eps) grid touches |
| `SPREAD_S125` | ES-kernel spreading, sigma=1.25 | 1.25N | wider w, 1.6x less memory |
| `RT` | sigma=1 Chebyshev-interpolated perturbation factor (Ruiz-Antolin/Townsend-style) | N (none) | K(eps) scaled FFT passes |

RT multiplicity is multiplicative across RT dims (K per dim), so the intended
use is RT on 1-2 memory-critical dims and spreading elsewhere.

## Files

- `nd_nufft.py` — the reference implementation (types 1 and 2, any d, both
  isigns, f64). Kernel parameters follow the standard ES rules exactly; RT factors
  are built by barycentric Chebyshev interpolation in the sub-cell offset with
  adaptive K selection.
- `validate.py` — accuracy matrix vs a direct NDFT oracle + adjoint identity,
  d = 1..5, all placements and mixes, both isigns, clustered points.

## Stage-1 verdict (2026-07-17)

`python validate.py` — 22/22 PASS. Relative l2 errors track eps for every
placement mix (e.g. 4D s1.25^3+RT at eps=1e-6: t1 4.3e-6, t2 4.2e-6); adjoint
residuals are at machine precision (<= 7e-12), confirming the type-1/type-2
composition is exactly consistent. The result shows that spread and RT
placements compose without measurable error inflation in this validation
matrix.

## Stage-2 verdict (2026-07-17)

`python cost.py` — analytic update counters match instrumented execution
exactly on every placement mix. Two corrections fed back into the design note:
(1) RT multiplicity K multiplies spreading work (per-point updates =
prod(w_spread) * prod(K_rt)), so per-point work is placement-invariant — the
"rank budget" is paid identically everywhere; placement chooses only where
memory and FFT passes go. (2) Interpolation-based K is ~10 at eps=1e-6 vs the
SVD floor of 7 (stage-3 optimization: SVD-derived factors).
Placement policy (`choose_placements`): sigma=2 for d<=3, sigma=1.25 for d>=4,
RT only under hard memory walls — it is exactly what fits 64^4 into a 256 MiB
browser budget (250 MiB); >=96^4 in browsers needs streaming/segmented
execution (wgpu-fft's large-route machinery, if adopted).

## Stage-3 milestone 1 (2026-07-17): rank-generic GPU spreading works

`gpu_experiment/` — standalone scratch crate (workspace-detached), generates the
S1 gather-form spreading kernel in WGSL for ANY dimension (d appears only as
unrolled generated code): one workgroup per output tile, one register
accumulator per owned cell, shared-memory point batches, per-dim ES weights
with periodic wrap, atomic-free. Host-side binning duplicates points into
touching tiles (scratch shortcut; production reads neighbor bins instead —
duplication 21x (d=3) to 200x (small d=4 grids)).

Vulkan results (`cargo run --release`, then `python check.py`):

| case | grid | median | throughput |
|---|---|---|---|
| d=3 256^3 s1.25, M=1e6, w=10 | 0.2 GiB | 8.99 ms | 1.11e11 upd/s |
| d=4 48^4 s1.25, M=5e5, w=10 | 0.1 GiB | 68.6 ms | 7.29e10 upd/s |
| d=4 64^4 s1.25, M=5e5, w=10 | 0.3 GiB | 73.2 ms | 6.83e10 upd/s |
| d=5 24^5 s1.25 eps=1e-3, M=2e5, w=5 | 0.2 GiB | 35.0 ms | 1.79e10 upd/s |

Correctness (d=4 exported case): rel-l2 = 1.11e-6 vs f64 numpy reference —
pure f32 accumulation error. Throughput at d=4 matches the class of the
hand-tuned production 2D bin-tile kernel (~6.7e10 upd/s), i.e. rank-generic
codegen costs essentially nothing in these measurements. The experiment
demonstrated GPU execution through d=5 on the tested configuration; it does not
make a claim about all other GPU NUFFT implementations.

## Stage-3 milestone 3b (2026-07-17): end-to-end d=4 on GPU

Full chains on the GPU, with **wgpu-fft as the ND FFT backend via its
public API** (a rank-4 plan over the 80^4 fine grid worked in the adoption
experiment): type-1 = GPU spread -> wgpu-fft forward FFT;
type-2 = host deconvolved pad -> wgpu-fft FFT -> new rank-generic GPU
interpolation kernel. 64^4 sigma=1.25 timings: type-1 79.5 ms, type-2 86.7 ms
(spreading/interp dominate, as the cost model predicts). wgpu-fft's forward
direction matches isign=-1.

Correctness (12^4 exported case, `python check2.py`): interior modes
(|k| <= N/4) at **3.56e-7** — clean f32; full-box rel-l2 3.76e-4/2.07e-4
(type-1/type-2). The gap is a REAL, measured design finding: **sigma=1.25
deconvolution conditioning** — 1/phi_hat amplifies f32 FFT rounding noise
~50x per dim at the mode-box edge (compounding toward corners). Invisible in
f64; material in f32. Candidate mitigations are an f64/df64 fine grid
for tight eps at sigma=1.25 (wgpu-fft has both), mode-box margin trimming, or
sigma=2 when memory allows. NOT prototyped here: production neighbor-bin reads
(adoption reuses wgpu-nufft's cell binning) — host duplication stays a scratch
shortcut.

## Stage-4 decision (2026-07-17)

**ADOPT — hybrid strategy.** The decision was to use rank-generic codegen for
d>=4 and as the universal fallback, while retaining tuned 1D/2D/3D kernels as
plan-selected fast paths. Production work belongs in `wgpu-nufft`, reusing its
cell binning and scan rather than this prototype's host-duplication shortcut.
This directory remains the historical reference oracle for the placement math;
its milestone descriptions report the state measured on 2026-07-17 rather than
the current production implementation status.
